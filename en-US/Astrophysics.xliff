        <source>The analytical theory of satellite orbits in an atmosphere developed by King-Hele remains widely in use for satellite mission design because of its accurate approximation to numerical integration under simplifying assumptions. Over the course of six decades, modifications to the theory have addressed many of its weaknesses. However, in all subsequent modifications of the original theory, the assumption of a constant drag-coefficient has been retained. The drag-coefficient is a dynamic parameter that governs the physical interaction between the atmosphere and the satellite and depends on ambient as well as satellite specific factors. In this work, Fourier series expansion models of the drag-coefficient are incorporated in the original King-Hele theory to capture time-variations of the drag-coefficient in averaging integrals. The modified theory is validated through simulations that demonstrate the attained improvements in approximating numerical results over the original King-Hele formulation.</source>

        <source>Accreting white dwarfs (WDs) constitute a significant fraction of the hard X-ray sources detected by the INTEGRAL observatory. Most of them are magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) of the intermediate polar (IP) and polar types, but the contribution of the Nova-likes systems and the systems with optically thin boundary layers, Dwarf Novae (DNs) and Symbiotic Binaries (or Symbiotic Stars, SySs) in quiescence is also not negligible. Here we present a short review of the results obtained from the observations of cataclysmic variables and symbiotic binaries by INTEGRAL. The highlight results include the significant increase of the known IP population, determination of the WD mass for a significant fraction of IPs, the establishment of the luminosity function of magnetic CVs, and uncovering origin of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission which appears to largely be associated with hard emission from magnetic CVs.</source>
