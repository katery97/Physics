'Astrophysics/arXiv2008.11890-abstract' => 'We present CO observations toward a sample of six HI-rich Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) as well as one UDG (VLSB-A) in the Virgo Cluster with the IRAM 30-m telescope. CO 1-0 is marginally detected at 4sigma level in AGC122966, as the first detection of CO emission in UDGs. We estimate upper limits of molecular mass in other galaxies from the non-detection of CO lines. These upper limits and the marginal CO detection in AGC122966 indicate low mass ratios between molecular and atomic gas masses. With the star formation efficiency derived from the molecular gas, we suggest that the inefficiency of star formation in such HI-rich UDGs is likely caused by the low efficiency in converting molecules from atomic gas, instead of low efficiency in forming stars from molecular gas.',
