'Physics/arXiv2008.12058.txt:abstract' => 'Proposals aimed at measuring the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) for charged particles require a good understanding of the systematic errors that can contribute to a vertical spin buildup mimicking the EDM signal to be detected. In what follows, a method of averaging emanating from the Bogoliubov-Krylov Mitropolski method is employed to solve the T-BMT equation and calculate the Berry phases arising for the storage ring frozen spin concept. The formalism employed proved to be particularly useful to determine the evolution of the spin at the observation point, i.e. at the location of the polarimeter. Several selected cases of lattice imperfections were simulated and benchmarked with the analytical estimates. This allowed the proof of the convergence of the numerical simulations and helped gain better understanding of the systematic errors.',
