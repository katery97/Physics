'Physics/arXiv2008.11736.txt:test' => 'Spin qubits of donors in silicon show some of the longest coherence times recorded and hold the promise of scalability with seamless integration of quantum computing into semiconductor fabrication. However, current entangling gate implementations rely on highly challenging precision donor placement and substantial gate tuning, rendering scaling challenging. In this work, we show how to implement placement-insensitive ultrafast entangling gates in deep and shallow donors in silicon by relying on the Rydberg blockade induced by strong interactions between low lying orbital excited states. We calculate multivalley interactions for several donor species using the Finite Element Method, and show that Van der Waals interactions between donors, calculated here for the first time, are important even for low-lying excited states. We show that blockade entangling gate operation is possible within the short lifetime of donor excited states with over 99% fidelity for the creation of a Bell state in the presence of decoherence. This gate substantially relaxes the requirements on single donor placement while allowing for billions of entangling gate operations within the single-qubit lifetime, thus paving the way for large scale quantum computation in silicon.',
